The source code is included but all you need to run the application is the exe. 

Since my posture is so bad I built a simple program to remind me to take breaks and work on posture while programming. To run it just download the executable (BreakReminder.exe). Set the 'work duration' and a 'break duration', then hit start. https://github.com/EvanDaley/BreakReminder
